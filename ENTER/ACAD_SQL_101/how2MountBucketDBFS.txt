1.  Show me the buckets already mounted to my DBFS:

	%fs mounts






2.  Mount your own bucket to a new mount point. To do so, use the dbutils.fs.mount(..) function.

	Below, mount a Databricks S3 bucket (using a read-only access and secret key pair), access one of the files in the bucket as a DBFS path, then unmount the bucket.

	Caution The mount point must start with /mnt/.

	Create the mount point with %fs mount.

		Caution If the directory was already mounted, you would receive the following error:

		Directory already mounted: /mnt/temp-training
	
	%fs mount s3a://AKIAJBRYNXGHORDHZB4A:a0BzE1bSegfydr3%2FGE3LSPM6uIV5A4hOUfpH8aFF@databricks-corp-training/common /mnt/temp-training







3.  List the contents of the directory you just mounted:

	%fs ls /mnt/temp-training

	see everything:

	dbfs:/mnt/temp-training/301/	301/	0
	dbfs:/mnt/temp-training/Chicago-Crimes-2018.csv	Chicago-Crimes-2018.csv	5201668
	dbfs:/mnt/temp-training/City-Data.delta/	City-Data.delta/	0
	dbfs:/mnt/temp-training/City-Data.parquet/	City-Data.parquet/	0
	dbfs:/mnt/temp-training/EDGAR-Log-20170329/	EDGAR-Log-20170329/	0
