For course purposes, data begins in the pipeline with **raw tables.** This refers to data that arrives in the pipeline, conforms to a schema, and does not include any sort of parsing or aggregation.\n\nRaw tables are then parsed into query-ready tables, known as **query tables.**  Query tables might populate a relational data model for ad hoc (OLAP) or online (OLTP) queries, but generally do not include any sort of aggregation such as daily averages.  Put another way, query tables are cleaned and filtered data.\n\nFinally, **summary tables** are business level aggregates often used for reporting and dashboarding. This includes aggregations such as daily active website visitors.\n\nIt is a good idea to preserve raw tables because it lets you adapt to future needs not considered in the original data model or correct parsing errors. This pipeline ensures data engineers always have access to the data they need, while reducing the barriers to common data access patterns. Data becomes more valuable and easier to access in each subsequent stage of the pipeline.  \n\n<div><img src=\"https://files.training.databricks.com/images/eLearning/ETL-Part-2/gold-silver-bronze.png\" style=\"height: 400px; margin: 20px\"/></div>"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## ![Spark Logo Tiny](https://files.training.databricks.com/images/105/logo_spark_tiny.png) Classroom-Cleanup<br>\n\nDuring the course of this lesson, files, tables, and other artifacts may have been created.\n\nThese resources create clutter, consume resources (generally in the form of storage), and may potentially incur some [minor] long-term expense.\n\nYou can remove these artifacts by running the **`Classroom-Cleanup`** cell below."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%run \"./Includes/Classroom-Cleanup\""],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":9},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Next Steps\n\nStart the lesson [Common Transformations]($./ETL2 02 - Common Transformations)."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["-sandbox\n&copy; 2020 Databricks, Inc.
